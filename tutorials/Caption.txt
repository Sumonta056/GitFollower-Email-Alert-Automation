🌱 My journey on GitHub started as a platform for both development and academic purposes. I've been active on the platform for quite some time now.  Increasing my GitHub followers has been a personal goal, as their engagement matters to me. However, once I noticed a gap: there was no system to track daily follower fluctuations or receive notifications about them.

So, I created a project which gives a simple yet powerful solution to streamline your GitHub follower tracking! With this automation, you'll receive 🔔 daily updates on your follower count straight to your personal email.

I've also included documentation on how to use this project for your own GitHub account, ensuring you stay informed about follower updates. Additionally, a video demonstration has been provided for better understanding. You can also contribute to project for more feature addition.
